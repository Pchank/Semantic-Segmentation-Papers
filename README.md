Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recentlyï¼ŒFully Convolution Network (FCN) has evolved to be the de facto network architecture in semantic segmentation. 
Even though FCN significantly advances the performance of semantic segmentation, there are several barriers 
when we build stronger segmentation network architectures.

To better understand semantic segmentation and capture the trends in the deep learning era.
In this repo, we colllect 191 papers (not complete yet) and focus on deep learning based segmentation methods.
